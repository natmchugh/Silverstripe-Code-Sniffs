A set of coding standards sniffs for Silverstripe.

To use download and copy Silverstripe directory alongside the other standards or use the full path in the command

e.g. phpcs --standard=/full/path/to/download

Troubleshooting:
-------------------------------
phpcs -i
will list all installed coding standards
if Silverstripe is not on the list make sure the code is in a directory called Silverstripe inside the Standards directory
